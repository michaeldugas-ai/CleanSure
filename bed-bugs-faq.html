They usually occur on exposed skin while sleeping - arms, legs, neck, and face. Bites may take several days to appear and can be mistaken for mosquito bites or hives. Not everyone reacts to bed bug bites, so lack of bites doesn't mean you don't have bed bugs. Look for other signs like spots on bedding or actual bugs."

Over-the-counter sprays are often ineffective due to pesticide resistance, and improper treatment can scatter bed bugs to other rooms, making the problem worse. DIY methods also can't reach bed bugs hiding deep in walls, furniture, and other hard-to-reach areas. Professional heat treatment eliminates the entire infestation in one day, saving you time, money, and frustration. Most people who attempt DIY end up calling professionals after months of failed attempts."

            "text": "Adult bed bugs typically live 6-12 months under normal conditions, and can survive up to a year without feeding. This survival ability makes them extremely difficult to eliminate through starvation methods. Bed bug eggs hatch in 6-10 days, nymphs mature to adults in 5-8 weeks, and females can lay 200-500 eggs in their lifetime. This rapid reproduction cycle means small infestations quickly become severe without professional treatment."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Bed bugs die instantly at temperatures above 120°F and within minutes at 113°F. Our heat treatment raises room temperatures to 120-140°F and maintains that temperature for several hours to ensure complete penetration into furniture, walls, and all hiding spots. This thermal approach kills bed bugs in all life stages - eggs, nymphs, and adults - with 100% effectiveness. Cold can also kill bed bugs, but requires sustained exposure to 0°F for at least 4 days, making it impractical for home treatment."

However, some landlords are required to pay for treatment in rental properties - check your local regulations. Some specialty pest control insurance riders exist but are rare.

They're white or cream-colored, oval-shaped, and often found in clusters in cracks and crevices near where bed bugs hide. The eggs have a sticky coating that attaches them to surfaces. While you can see them, they're easy to miss without knowing what to look for. Professional inspections use specialized tools and trained eyes to locate all life stages including eggs."
